\begin{abstract}
The purpose of this document is to develop designs and evaluate alternatives for a runtime system for the reactive component model.
In section~\ref{model}, I review the reactive component model and the major constraints it places on the runtime system.
In section~\ref{runtime}, I describe the features of a runtime system for reactive components.
In section~\ref{design}, I outline the design of a runtime system for reactive components.
%In section~\ref{language}, I outline the design of a programming language for reactive components based on the constraints imposed by the model and runtime system.
